# Translate-to-Assembly-language-in-C

Use the make (just write make in terminal) to generate the access file
There are 6 test case included and put:
EX.
./compile test0

it will generate a file called tinyL.out

now this is the assembly language in tinyL.out, but did not simplified, the put:
./optimize <tinyL.out> (file name you want to output)

EX.
./optimize <tinyL.out> optimized.out

Then in optimized.out, will be simplified assembly language.
